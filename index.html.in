<h1> Toshset </h1><p>

    Toshset is a command-line tool allowing access to much of the
Toshiba hardware interface. It can do things like control
display brightness, set the fan speed, and enable the optional
Bluetooth interface.

    Credit for the difficult task of reverse-engineering the Toshiba
hardware interface goes to others, principly Jonathan Buzzard.
His tools can be found at

Toshset can now be used under ACPI if the
<a href="http://memebeam.org/toys/ExperimentalToshibaAcpiDriver">
experimental toshiba acpi driver</a>
from John Belmonte is used. This 
<a href="http://www.flurble.org/computers/toshset.pl">
site 
</a>
has additional hints if you have
toshset trouble and are running ACPI.


<p>

The current version is __VERSION__. 
<p>
new:
<ul>
<li> added support for built-in 3G modem
<li> added new fan mode
<li> can now be run as nonroot user (need read/write /dev/toshiba
  access) 
</ul>
not as new new:
<ul>
<li> added support for transreflective displays (e.g. Portege R500). Thanks
     to Laurent L&eacute;onard.
<li> 64-bit (AMD64) version will now build.
<li> new and updated machine ids.
<li> fixes for battery reporting status - now works for the second battery.
<li> features added by G. L. Gragnani:
      USB legacy mode, USB FDD emulation mode, LAN controller, sound logo,
  startup logo
<li> added sci/hci interface information to output: reports whether toshset is
     using the kernel interface, or direct calls to the BIOS.
<li> cleaned up SCI/HCI interface: now will only use the kernel interface 
     if /proc/toshiba is present, and will fail if ACPI is in use, and no 
     kernel interafce is found.
<li> added -inten option, to control LCD brightness through the HCI
     interface. This provides finer granularity than -lcd access, and seems 
     to work under the latest experimental toshiba_acpi module versions.
<li> now can query wireless status, and enable internal bluetooth
     adapter.
<li> now optionally uses the toshiba kernel interface (compile-time flag).
<li> fixed autooff feature.
<li> added three video-out modes. See README.video in the distribution.
<li> setting the owner/user password now works
<li> setting/querying the owner string now works
</ul>

The binary should work with 2.4 and 2.6 Linux kernels. It may work for others
as well. 
<p>
toshset -h for help.
Patches, comments and the output of toshset -v -q are welcome.
