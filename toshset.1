.SH NAME
toshset \- manipulate bios and hardware settings of Toshiba laptops
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B toshset
[\fITOGGLEOPTIONS\fR | \fIQUERYOPTIONS\fR | \fIFEATUREOPTIONS\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Toshset ia a command-line tool to allow access to much of the
Toshiba hardware interface developed by Jonathan Buzzard. It can do
things like set the hard drive spin-down time, turn off the display
and set the fan speed.

Credit for the difficult task of
reverse-engineering the Toshiba hardware interface goes to Jonathan Buzzard.
A link for Jonathan's tools is

All options are listed by running toshset with no arguments. 

If an argument option is specified as the ``-'' character, stdin is
read for that option. This is particularly convenient when setting the
owner string.

The method used for access to the laptop hardware is given by the the
HCI/SCI access mode query field. This should be kernel or direct. The
kernel method requires kernel support and it is the only access method
supported for ACPI kernels. If ACPI is not used this package does not
require a special kernel module. Also, it is highly likely that this
tool will work under different flavors of *NIX. As a result of this
design consideration, and because of my own desire that not every user
be able to change my laptop's hardware settings, the user must have
read/write permission to /dev/toshiba in order for this program to run
properly.  


.PP
.SS "Toggle Options:"
.TP
\fB\-l\fR
toggle long query in which the assocated command-line option is
printed with each queried feature.
.TP
\fB\-fast\fR
run in fast mode: a startup check is skipped, and values are not
queried after the are set. On machines for which ioctl is slow, this
can speed toshset up by up to a factor of 2/5.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR
toggle verbose mode in which normally silent messages are printed.
.PP
.SS "Query Options:"
.TP
\fB\-q\fR \fI [glob]\fR
query features specified by glob (all features if glob omitted). The
glob string is sandwiched between asterisks, so specifying -q bat will
query all features whose names contain the ``bat'' substring. If no
glob is given, then all features are queried.
.PP
.SS "Feature Options:"
Valid settings for features can be listed by omitting the
argument. The current list of feature options is 
.TP
\fB\-b\fR \fI <off|on> \fR
enable/disable system beep
.TP
\fB\-lcd\fR \fI<setting>\fR
set lcd brightness. 
.TP
\fB\-inten\fR \fI<setting>\fR
set lcd brightness. Not all models support both -lcd and -inten.
.TP
\fB\-pow\fR \fI<setting>\fR
set power-up mode
.TP
\fB\-vol\fR \fI<0-4>\fR
set beep volume. Note that this controls the modem volume for my
PCMCIA modem.
.TP
\fB\-hdd\fR \fI<num>\fR
number of minutes until disk spindown
.TP
\fB\-dstretch\fR \fI<off|on>\fR
enable/disable display stretch
.TP
\fB\-d\fR \fI<num>\fR
number of minutes until display auto-off
.TP
\fB\-c\fR \fI<method>\fR
set cooling method
.TP
\fB\-bs\fR \fI<setting>\fR
set battery-save mode
.TP
\fB\-bl\fR \fI<off|on>\fR
control lcd backlight
.TP
\fB\-bluetooth\fR \fI<off|on>\fR
power-up + attach internal bluetooth device, or shutdown.
.TP
\fB\-fan\fR \fI<setting>\fR
control fan
.TP
\fB\-video\fR \fI<int|ext|both|tv|mode5|mode6|mode7>\fR
set display device for video: internal lcd, external monitor, or tv-out
.TP
\fB\-cpu\fR \fI<slow|fast>\fR
set CPU speed
.TP
\fB\-cpucache\fR \fI<off|on>\fR
enable/disable CPU cache
.TP
\fB\-sleep\fR \fI<off|on>\fR
enable/disable CPU sleep mode
.TP
\fB\-balarm\fR \fI<off|on>\fR
enable/disable battery alarm
.TP
\fB\-palarm\fR \fI<off|on>\fR
enable/disable lid-closed alarm
.TP
\fB\-walarm\fR \fI<dis|HH:MM[/everyday|DD/MM[/YYYY]]>\fR
set time/date to wake
.TP
\fB\-ppower\fR \fI<off|on>\fR
enable/disable annoying feature of powering-off computer when lid is
closed. 
.TP
\fB\-parallel\fR \fI<mode>\fR
set parallel port mode
.TP
\fB\-autooff\fR <num>\fR
number of minutes of idle time until system auto-off
.TP
\fB\-ostring\fR \fI<owner string>\fR
set owner string. This string is displayed at boot or resume time, if
a user or supervisor password is set.
.TP
\fB\-upasswd\fR 
set or clear the user password. Toshset must be run on the console for
this to work. The password should be entered when the prompt is
displayed. If the password is currently set, entering it will clear
the password.
.TP
\fB\-spasswd\fR 
set the supervisor password. See the docs for -upasswd.
.TP
\fB\-usblegacy\fR 
USB legacy mode: enable/disable using an USB mouse as it would be a PS/2
one, without the need to install a USB driver.
.TP
\fB\-3g\fR 
power-up + attach internal 3g modem device, or shutdown.
.TP
\fB\-usbfdd\fR 
USB FDD emulation mode: is almost the same of the previous one for a
floppy. It enables the use of an USB floppy as it would be attached to
an internal FD controller (for booting etc.)
.TP
\fB\-lan\fR 
Enables/disables internal LAN controller.
.TP
\fB\-soundlogo\fR 
enable/disable startup sound logo.
.TP
\fB\-startlogo\fR 
startup logo mode (picture or animation>.
.TP
\fB\-trmode\fR 
enable/disable the display's transreflective mode.

Features may also be set by specifying the (zero-offset) index of the
option. e.g. toshset -cpu 0 sets the cpu speed to slow.

.SH BUGS
Many features are locked and can not be changed when the battery save
mode is not ``user.'' Since I only have one laptop, I can't test
this utility on other hardware. User feedback in this regard is
helpful. Some features do not work on my laptop and they may work on
your's, and visa-versa.

Toshset requires an experimental version of the toshiba_acpi kernel
module with an ACPI-enabled kernel.
